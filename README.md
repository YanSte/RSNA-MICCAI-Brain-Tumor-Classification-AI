# RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Classification AI

The aim of this project is to predict the presence of a specific genetic mutation in a brain tumor called glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images to train and test a model for detecting the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

MGMT promoter methylation has been shown to be a favorable prognostic factor and a strong predictor of chemotherapy sensitivity. However, current genetic analysis of cancer requires surgical intervention to obtain a tissue sample, followed by a waiting period of up to several weeks to determine the genetic characterization of the tumor. In the case of a positive result for the mutation, additional surgical intervention may be necessary.

This project was initiated by the competition organized by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society (MICCAI Society) with the aim of improving the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with glioblastoma.

Using the MRI images provided for the competition, the model is trained to predict the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in brain tumors. It could help brain cancer patients receive less invasive diagnoses and treatments, improving their management, survival, and recovery prospects.
