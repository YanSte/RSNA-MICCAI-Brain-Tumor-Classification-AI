# Introduction

The RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification Contest is a multi-class classification problem, giving MRIs based on radiomic features, where the goal is to predict the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

Project [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yannicksteph/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-classification)

There are three classes: 
- LGG (low-grade glioma)
- HGG (high-grade glioma) 
- WT (hemangioblastoma)

The dataset we will be working with consists of MRI datasets provided by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNAÂ®) and the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society (the MICCAI Society). The images are provided in DICOM format and are accompanied by a CSV file containing radiomic features extracted from the images.

Here's the competition [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/data?select=train_labels.csv)

# Dataset

The exact mpMRI scans included are:
- Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
    * What it is: These are images that detect brain abnormalities, such as edema and inflammatory lesions. These images are sensitive to the detection of anomalies related to inflammatory and infectious diseases of the central nervous system.
    * What it highlights: It helps to detect anomalies in the brain that might not be visible in other MRI sequences.
    * These images allow for the detection of brain abnormalities related to inflammatory and infectious diseases of the central nervous system.
- T1-weighted pre-contrast (T1w)
    * What it is: These are images that highlight soft tissues, such as muscles and nerves, and are useful for visualizing normal brain structures.
    * What it highlights: It allows the visualization of the normal brain structures and also helps in the detection of tumors and lesions.
    * These images allow for the detection of brain tumors and lesions.
- T1-weighted post-contrast (T1Gd)
    * What it is: These are images that use a contrast agent to detect vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions, which are more visible after contrast agent administration.
    * What it highlights: It enhances the visibility of vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions, making it easier to detect them.
    * These images allow for the detection of vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions.
- T2-weighted (T2)
    * What it is: These images detect abnormalities related to demyelination, such as multiple sclerosis, as well as brain tumors and lesions.
    * What it highlights: It helps in the detection of anomalies related to cerebrospinal fluid, such as cysts and brain tumors.
    * These images allow for the detection of anomalies related to demyelination, brain tumors, lesions, and cerebrospinal fluid.
