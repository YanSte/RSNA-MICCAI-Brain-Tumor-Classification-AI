structures.\n","    * What it highlights: It allows the visualization of the normal brain structures and also helps in the detection of tumors and lesions.\n","    * These images allow for the detection of brain tumors and lesions.\n","- T1-weighted post-contrast (T1Gd)\n","    * What it is: These are images that use a contrast agent to detect vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions, which are more visible after contrast agent administration.\n","    * What it highlights: It enhances the visibility of vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions, making it easier to detect them.\n","    * These images allow for the detection of vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions.\n","- T2-weighted (T2)\n","    * What it is: These images detect abnormalities related to
