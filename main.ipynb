The images are provided in DICOM format and are accompanied by a CSV file containing radiomic features extracted from the images.\n\nHere's the competition [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/data?select=train_labels.csv)\n\n# Contributors\n\n- [David Goudard](https://www.kaggle.com/goudgoud)\n- [Louis-Marie Renaud](https://www.kaggle.com/louismarierenaud)\n- [Yannick Stephan](https://github.com/YanSteph)\n\n\n# Dataset\n\nThe exact mpMRI scans included are:\n- Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)\n    * What it is: These are images that detect brain abnormalities, such as edema and inflammatory lesions. These images are sensitive to the detection of anomalies related to inflammatory and infectious diseases of the central nervous system.\n    * What it highlights: It helps to detect anomalies in the brain that might not be visible in other MRI sequences.\n    * These images allow for the detection of brain abnormalities related to inflammatory and infectious diseases of the central nervous system.\n- T1-weighted pre-contrast (T1w)\n    * What it is: These are images that highlight soft tissues, such as muscles and nerves, and are useful for visualizing normal brain structures.\n    * What it highlights: It allows the visualization of the normal brain structures and also helps in the detection of tumors and lesions.\n    * These images allow for the detection of brain tumors and lesions.\n- T1-weighted post-contrast (T1Gd)\n    * What it is: These are images that use a contrast agent to detect vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions, which are more visible after contrast agent administration.\n    * What it highlights: It enhances the visibility of vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions, making it easier to detect them.\n    * These images allow for the detection of vascular anomalies, such as tumors and lesions.\n- T2-weighted (T2)\n    * What it is: These images detect abnormalities related to demyelination, such as multiple sclerosis, as well as brain tumors and lesions.\n    * What it highlights: It helps in the detection of anomalies related to cerebrospinal fluid, such as cysts and brain tumors.\n    * These images allow for the detection of anomalies related to demyelination, brain tumors, lesions, and cerebrospinal fluid.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-14T19:19:16.412499Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-14T19:19:16.41328Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-14T19:19:17.264665Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-14T19:19:16.413115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-14T19:19:17.263011Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Necessary imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Operating System and File System\nimport os \n\n# Data Manipulation and Analysis\nimport numpy as np  \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Data Visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Warnings\nimport warnings  # For suppressing warnings\n\n# JSON Handling\nimport json  # For working with JSON data\n\n# Encoding and Decoding Binary Data\nimport base64  # For encoding and decoding binary data\n\n# Interactive Widgets and Display\nimport ipywidgets as widgets  # For creating interactive widgets in Jupyter Notebook\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, display  # For displaying HTML content\n\n# Deep Learning Framework\nimport torch  # For working with PyTorch deep learning framework\n\n# DICOM File Handling\nimport pydicom  # For reading DICOM files\nfrom pydicom import dcmread  # For reading DICOM files\n\n# Image Processing and Filtering\nimport SimpleITK as sitk  # For image filtering\nfrom PIL import Image  # For image processing using the Python Imaging Library (PIL)\n\n# Machine Learning and Data Splitting\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # For splitting data into training and testing sets\n\n# Additional Libraries\n!pip install pyradiomics > /dev/null  # Installing the pyradiomics library for radiomics feature extraction\nimport radiomics  # For extracting radiomics features from medical images\n\n# Suppressing Warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T10:09:14.7328Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T10:09:14.733207Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T10:09:28.141734Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T10:09:14.733181Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T10:09:28.13846Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

This library is based on the Unet neural network architecture and specifically designed for brain segmentation from medical images.\n\nBy leveraging the capabilities of this library, accurate brain segmentation was achieved on the images within our dataset. Segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging as it enables the extraction of precise information about different regions or classes, in this case, brain structures.\n\nThe selection of the **\"mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet\"** library was based on its exceptional performance and user-friendly nature. It provides an efficient implementation of the Unet architecture, renowned for its success in biomedical image segmentation. Consequently, our project was able to deliver reliable and accurate results for brain segmentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the utilization of the **\"mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet\"** library played a pivotal role in acquiring accurate brain segmentation data for our dataset. By leveraging this library, we efficiently segmented medical images and extracted valuable information to further our project's objectives.\n\nSource: [mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet on PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet/)\n\n#### Library\n\nTo achieve tumor segmentation, the U-Net for Brain MRI model will be employed.\n\nU-Net for Brain MRI is a convolutional neural network model specifically designed for segmenting brain MRI images. It features a U-shaped architecture with branch connections, comprising four levels of blocks. Each block consists of two convolution layers with batch normalization, ReLU activation function, and an encoding part with a max pooling layer, while the decoding part utilizes up-convolution. The number of convolution filters varies across the model's levels, ranging from 32 to 256.\n\nTo utilize the model, an input brain MRI image with three channels corresponding to pre-contrast, FLAIR, and post-contrast sequences should be provided. The image should be scaled to a size of 256x256 pixels and normalized using the z-score method per volume.\n\nThe pre-trained U-Net model produces a single-channel probability map indicating anomalous regions in the input image. By applying an appropriate threshold, this probability map can be converted into a binary segmentation mask.\n\nIn summary, U-Net for Brain MRI is a pre-trained model capable of automatically segmenting abnormalities in brain MRI images. Its application extends to various medical imaging tasks, including brain tumor detection and analysis.\n\n\nTo perform shape analysis and extract relevant features, the **\"radiomics.shape2D.RadiomicsShape2D\"** class will be utilized.\n\nSource: [Radiomics.shape2D.RadiomicsShape2D ](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#module-radiomics.shape2D)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Skip brain segmentation with PyTorch UNet\nskip_brain_segmentation_pytorch_unet = False","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:52:37.500315Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:52:37.500801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:52:37.506582Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:52:37.500768Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:52:37.505594Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Initialisation\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch, U-Net with batch normalization for biomedical image segmentation with pretrained weights for abnormality segmentation in brain MRI","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch, U-Net with batch normalization for biomedical image segmentation with pretrained weights for abnormality segmentation in brain MRI\nsegmentation_model = torch.hub.load('mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch', 'unet', in_channels=3, out_channels=1, init_features=32, pretrained=True, trust_repo=False)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T07:25:34.074282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T07:25:34.074791Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T07:26:33.251987Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T07:25:34.074765Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T07:26:33.25112Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"The repository mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch does not belong to the list of trusted repositories and as such cannot be downloaded.
